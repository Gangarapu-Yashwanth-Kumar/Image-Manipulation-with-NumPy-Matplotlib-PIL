# 🖼️ Image-Manipulation-with-NumPy-Matplotlib-PIL

## 📝 Description
Master image basics! 🖼️ Learn reading, processing, and manipulation with Python's NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL. Perfect for beginners diving into digital image fundamentals. Explore pixels, colors, and transformations easily. 💡🎨💻

## ✨ Key Features/Concepts Covered
This repository demonstrates fundamental concepts and operations in digital image processing using Python:
* **Image Reading**: How to load various image formats using PIL (Pillow).
* **Image Representation**: Understanding images as NumPy arrays and accessing pixel data.
* **Basic Image Properties**: Retrieving image mode (e.g., RGB) and dimensions (width, height).
* **Image Display**: Visualizing images using Matplotlib for analysis and presentation.
* **Fundamental Manipulations**: *(If applicable, you can add more based on your notebook's content, e.g., "Grayscaling", "Resizing", "Cropping", "Color Channel Operations" etc.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations and treating images as multi-dimensional arrays.
* **Matplotlib**: For plotting and displaying images within the notebook environment.
* **PIL (Pillow)**: The Python Imaging Library fork, used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Image-Manipulation-with-NumPy-Matplotlib-PIL.git](https://github.com/your-username/Image-Manipulation-with-NumPy-Matplotlib-PIL.git)
    cd Image-Manipulation-with-NumPy-Matplotlib-PIL
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow jupyter
    ```

### Running the Notebook
1.  **Place your image files** (e.g., `jaihanuman.jpg` as referenced in the notebook) in the same directory as the `.ipynb` file, or update the paths within the notebook.
2.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Open `Image Reading,Processing using Np,Plt,PIL.ipynb`** from the Jupyter interface in your web browser.
4.  **Run the cells** sequentially to see the image processing steps and outputs.
